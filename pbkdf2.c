 *
 *    5.2 PBKDF2
 *
 *       PBKDF2 applies a pseudorandom function (see Appendix B.1 for an
 *       example) to derive keys. The length of the derived key is essentially
 *       unbounded. (However, the maximum effective search space for the
 *       derived key may be limited by the structure of the underlying
 *       pseudorandom function. See Appendix B.1 for further discussion.)
 *       PBKDF2 is recommended for new applications.
 *
 *       PBKDF2 (P, S, c, dkLen)
 *
 *       Options:        PRF        underlying pseudorandom function (hLen
 *                                  denotes the length in octets of the
 *                                  pseudorandom function output)
 *
 *       Input:          P          password, an octet string
 *                       S          salt, an octet string
 *                       c          iteration count, a positive integer
 *                       dkLen      intended length in octets of the derived
 *                                  key, a positive integer, at most
 *                                  (2^32 - 1) * hLen
 *
 *       Output:         DK         derived key, a dkLen-octet string
 *
 *       Steps:
 *
 *          1. If dkLen > (2^32 - 1) * hLen, output "derived key too long" and
 *             stop.
 *
 *          2. Let l be the number of hLen-octet blocks in the derived key,
 *             rounding up, and let r be the number of octets in the last
 *             block:
 *
 *                       l = CEIL (dkLen / hLen) ,
 *                       r = dkLen - (l - 1) * hLen .
 *
 *             Here, CEIL (x) is the "ceiling" function, i.e. the smallest
 *             integer greater than, or equal to, x.
 *
 *          3. For each block of the derived key apply the function F defined
 *             below to the password P, the salt S, the iteration count c, and
 *             the block index to compute the block:
 *
 *                       T_1 = F (P, S, c, 1) ,
 *                       T_2 = F (P, S, c, 2) ,
 *                       ...
 *                       T_l = F (P, S, c, l) ,
 *
 *             where the function F is defined as the exclusive-or sum of the
 *             first c iterates of the underlying pseudorandom function PRF
 *             applied to the password P and the concatenation of the salt S
 *             and the block index i:
 *
 *
 *                       F (P, S, c, i) = U_1 \xor U_2 \xor ... \xor U_c
 *
 *             where
 *
 *                       U_1 = PRF (P, S || INT (i)) ,
 *                       U_2 = PRF (P, U_1) ,
 *                       ...
 *                       U_c = PRF (P, U_{c-1}) .
 *
 *             Here, INT (i) is a four-octet encoding of the integer i, most
 *             significant octet first.
 *
 *          4. Concatenate the blocks and extract the first dkLen octets to
 *             produce a derived key DK:
 *
 *                       DK = T_1 || T_2 ||  ...  || T_l<0..r-1>
 *
 *          5. Output the derived key DK.
 *
 *       Note. The construction of the function F follows a "belt-and-
 *       suspenders" approach. The iterates U_i are computed recursively to
 *       remove a degree of parallelism from an opponent; they are exclusive-
 *       ored together to reduce concerns about the recursion degenerating
 *       into a small set of values.
